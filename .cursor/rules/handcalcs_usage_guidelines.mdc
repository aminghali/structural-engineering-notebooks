# Handcalcs Usage Guidelines

## Handcalcs Setup and Configuration:

1. **Import and Configuration**:
   ```python
   import handcalcs.render
   from handcalcs import handcalc
   ```

2. **Decorator Usage**:
   - Use `@handcalc()` decorator for calculation functions
   - Use `%%render` magic command for cell-level rendering
   - Configure precision for engineering accuracy (typically 3-4 decimal places)

3. **Variable Display**:
   - Use meaningful variable names that render well in LaTeX
   - Include units in variable comments: `# [kN/mÂ²]`
   - Group related calculations logically

## Best Practices for Structural Engineering:

1. **Equation Formatting**:
   - Break complex equations into multiple steps
   - Show intermediate calculations clearly
   - Use proper engineering notation and symbols
   - Include dimensionless ratios and factors

2. **Unit Handling**:
   - Always include units in comments or variable names
   - Perform unit conversions explicitly and show them
   - Use consistent unit systems throughout calculations
   - Validate dimensional consistency

3. **Professional Presentation**:
   - Use descriptive variable names (not just f, M, V)
   - Include subscripts and superscripts in variable names where appropriate
   - Show design code references in comments
   - Group calculations by engineering logic (loads, analysis, design, checks)

## Integration with LaTeX Templates:

1. **Template Compatibility**:
   - Ensure handcalcs output is compatible with Cambridge style template
   - Format equations to match professional report standards
   - Include proper equation numbering and referencing

2. **Report Generation**:
   - Export handcalcs results to LaTeX format
   - Integrate with existing template structure
   - Maintain consistent formatting throughout report

## Common Structural Engineering Applications:

1. **Load Calculations**:
   - Dead loads, live loads, wind loads, seismic loads
   - Load combinations per applicable codes
   - Load path analysis

2. **Structural Analysis**:
   - Moment and shear calculations
   - Deflection analysis
   - Stability checks

3. **Member Design**:
   - Concrete design (ACI 318)
   - Steel design (AISC 360)
   - Connection design

4. **Code Compliance**:
   - Show code equation references
   - Include safety factors and load factors
   - Document compliance checks
