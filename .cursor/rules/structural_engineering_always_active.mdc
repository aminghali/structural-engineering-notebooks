# ALWAYS ACTIVE RULE: Structural Engineering Jupiter Notebooks

This project is specifically aimed at creating Jupiter notebooks for structural engineering calculations that follow professional structural engineering format and standards.

## Core Requirements:

1. **Professional Format**: All calculations must follow professional structural engineering presentation standards
2. **Handcalcs Package**: Use the `handcalcs` package for proper mathematical presentation and symbolic calculations
3. **Python Jupiter Best Practices**: Follow proper coding standards for Python Jupiter notebooks
4. **LaTeX Templates**: Each calculation must have a corresponding LaTeX template based on the Cambridge style template located in the `templates/` folder
5. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Include detailed calculations, equations, derivation steps, and plots in professional format

## Template Structure:
- Base templates are in `templates/` folder:
  - `cambridge_style_template.tex` - Main Cambridge style template


## Output Requirements:
- Each notebook should generate professional-quality reports
- Include step-by-step calculations with proper engineering notation
- Generate plots and diagrams using matplotlib with professional styling
- Export results to LaTeX format using the appropriate template
- Store outputs in `output/` folder with proper timestamps and organization

## Quality Standards:
- Follow structural engineering codes and standards (ACI, AISC, IBC, etc.)
- Include proper units and dimensional analysis
- Provide clear variable definitions and assumptions
- Include references to relevant design codes and standards
- Maintain professional presentation throughout

This rule is ALWAYS ACTIVE and must be considered for every development decision in this project.
