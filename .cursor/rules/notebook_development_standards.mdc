# Notebook Development Standards

## Notebook Structure Standards:

1. **Standard Notebook Layout**:
   - Header cell with project title, date, engineer name, and revision info
   - Executive summary cell explaining the calculation purpose
   - Input parameters section with clear variable definitions
   - Calculation methodology section with step-by-step derivations
   - Results summary with key findings
   - References and code citations

2. **Cell Organization**:
   - Use markdown cells for explanations and section headers
   - Keep code cells focused on single calculations or operations
   - Use proper markdown headers (##, ###) for section organization
   - Number equations and reference them in text

3. **Variable Naming**:
   - Use descriptive variable names following engineering notation
   - Include units in variable names or comments where appropriate
   - Group related variables together
   - Use consistent naming conventions throughout

## Code Quality Standards:

1. **Imports and Setup**:
   - Import all required packages at the top of notebook
   - Include handcalcs, numpy, matplotlib, pandas as standard imports
   - Set up matplotlib for professional plotting style
   - Configure handcalcs for proper symbolic display

2. **Documentation**:
   - Document all assumptions clearly
   - Explain engineering principles behind calculations
   - Include inline comments for complex operations
   - Reference design codes and standards used

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Include input validation where appropriate
   - Handle edge cases and provide warnings
   - Check for reasonable output ranges
   - Include sensitivity analysis where relevant

## File Management:

1. **Notebook Organization**:
   - Store notebooks in `notebooks/` folder
   - Use descriptive filenames with version numbers
   - Include date stamps in filename for tracking
   - Organize by calculation type or project

2. **Output Management**:
   - Generate outputs to `output/` folder with timestamps
   - Create separate folders for different output types
   - Export both .pdf and .tex versions of reports
   - Maintain clean notebook outputs for version control
